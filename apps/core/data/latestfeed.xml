Italy (2-0-0) has dominated thus far at Euro 2020, posting 3-0 wins over Turkey and Switzerland. Wales (1-0-1) tied Switzerland 1-1 to open play and then defeated Turkey 2-0 on Wednesday. <br /><br />
Kickoff is set for noon ET at Stadio Olimpico in Rome.

The over-under for total goals scored is 2.5 in the Wales vs. Italy odds. Before making any Italy vs. Wales picks, check out the UEFA Euro 2020 predictions and best bets from SportsLine&#039;s Martin Green.<br /><br />

Green has his finger on the pulse of the game all over the globe.<br /><br />
